## Golang Linter Configuration

Execute the linter with:

    make lint

If you want to run the linter with auto-fixing, run:

    make lint-fix

## Build

Run the following command to build the application:

    make clean build

## Test

Testing setup and execution is left to the developer.

## Deploy


### Deploy to Production

Deployment to network-one-production is done by GitHub Actions on a push to the main branch

Ensure that the [.github/workflows/release.yaml](.github/workflows/release.yaml) has the TODO addressed to enable deployment to production

## API Specification

This document outlines the usage and specifications of two APIs. These APIs are designed for handling events from the LINE platform and broadcasting messages to users subscribed to a specific official account.

### /line-events

This API acts as a webhook for the LINE Bot, receiving and processing various events from the LINE platform.

#### Request Method

`POST`

### /notifications

This API allows for broadcasting messages to all users who have subscribed to the specific official account through a POST request.

#### Request Method

`POST`

#### Request Body

The body of the request should be in JSON format, containing a single field `message` which is a string representing the message you wish to broadcast. For example:

```json
{
  "message": "Did you take your fish oil today?\nPlease enter\n1. Yes\n2. No\nIf you haven't taken it or haven't responded, I will remind you again in 10 minutes."
}
